      I'm Nobody! Who are you? Are you - Nobody - Too? <br />
      Then there's a pair of us! Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!
      <br />
      How public - like a Frog - To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an
      admiring Bog!
    </p>
